### Introduction to Geoengineering
Geoengineering is a method of reducing or counteracting the negative impacts of climate change, by manipulating different environmental processes (Zhang et al., 2015). As climate change effects become more pronounced, geoengineering is being advocated for by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a potential solution (de Coninck et al., 2018; Reynolds, 2019). There are two major geoengineering categories, carbon dioxide removal (CDR), where atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is directly removed, and solar radiation management (SRM), where the technology reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth (Zhang et al., 2015). 

### BECCS and SAI
Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a form of CDR which uses plants for capturing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, reducing its greenhouse effect (Gough et al., 2018). The plants are then burned, allowing for long term storage of the carbon produced and the extraction of usable energy (Gough et al., 2018).

Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) is a SRM technique that involves the injection of sulphuric acid into the upper layers of the atmosphere to mimic the effects of volcanic eruptions (Pope et al., 2012; Preston, 2017). Lofted by a specialized aircraft, these particles would limit incoming solar radiation and lower global temperature (Robock et al., 2009). 

### How do BECCS and SAI Compare? 
BECCS and SAI have distinct implementation strategies. A global BECCS initiative is made up of many individual units, while SAI is a large, centralized operation that requires massive initial development (Brovkin et al., 2009; National Research Council, 2015). This gives BECCS the ability to function using various private enterprises, as opposed to SAI, which requires collective initiative and funding from multiple nations. Once implemented, BECCS can start and stop operation with no negative implications, as it only affects the rate at which CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the atmosphere. SAI, on the other hand, carries the risk of a termination shock if injections were stopped, potentially causing a rapid and damaging rise in temperatures (Brovkin et al., 2009). Other important factors including environmental impacts, government and public approval, and financial considerations of BECCS and SAI can be found in Table 1, which demonstrate the favourability of BECCS.

| Does not require large land use/deforestation for the technology to be implemented (Gough and Upham, 2011)                                         |         :x:        | :heavy_check_mark: |

| More cost-effective in the long run (Smith and Wagner, 2018)                                                                                       |         :x:        | :heavy_check_mark: |

| Likely to gain public support for wide-spread implementation (Corry, 2017)                                                                         | :heavy_check_mark: |         :x:        |

### Limitations of Geoengineering 
However, due to geoengineering being a rapidly growing industry, there are many challenges in its implementation. While the engineering of the technology is driving the enterprise forward, public and political perception often limits its roll-out, since there is hesitation in implementing such world-altering solutions. This is also brought on by the limitations of models and small-scale studies, which may not accurately predict costs, benefits, and consequences of the technologies. 

### Conclusions and Next Steps
BECCS and SAI are not directly comparable as they affect the climate through different methods. However, their comparison is important when considering the future of the Earth to make the most informed decisions. While one single geoengineering project may not be the sole solution to climate change, it is important to choose the best option and weigh the risks and rewards. BECCS appears to be more feasible than SAI, with a higher probability of being implemented in the future, possibly in conjunction with other methods of reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The execution of the solutions at maximum efficacy requires a deeper understanding of the technologies, as well as the need for public education in order to garner support. Geoengineering may hold the key to our salvation, and the merging of critical analysis and accelerated development is crucial in order to draw out its full potential.
